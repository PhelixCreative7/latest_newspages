I want to build a College News Portal Website using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The project should allow college administrators or teachers to post weekly or event-based news updates, which are then displayed publicly on the college website for students and visitors to read.

🎯 Project Overview:

The main goal is to create a web-based platform for displaying the latest college news and events.

There should be two main sections:

Public News Page: visible to everyone (students, staff, visitors).

Admin Dashboard: only accessible to a few authorized users (teachers/admins) who can add, edit, and delete news posts.

👥 User Roles:

Public Users (Students/Visitors):

Can view all posted news and events.

Each post should show: title, description, event date, posted by (teacher/admin name), and an image if available.

News should be shown in reverse chronological order (newest first).

Admin Users (Teachers):

Can log in using a username and password.

After login, access an Admin Dashboard where they can:

Add new news posts with title, description, image upload, and event date.

Edit or delete existing posts.

View all posts they’ve created.

🗄️ Database Requirements:

The database should be named college_news and contain at least two tables:

users — for storing teacher/admin login info
Columns:

id (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY)

username (VARCHAR, unique)

password (VARCHAR, hashed using PHP’s password_hash())

full_name (VARCHAR)

created_at (TIMESTAMP)

news — for storing news/events
Columns:

id (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY)

title (VARCHAR)

description (TEXT)

image (VARCHAR, file path to uploaded image)

event_date (DATE)

created_by (INT, foreign key linked to users.id)

created_at (TIMESTAMP)

🧩 Backend Functionality (PHP + MySQL):

Use PDO for secure database connections and queries.

All admin pages should be session-protected (cannot access without login).

Passwords must be securely stored using PHP’s password_hash() and verified with password_verify().

Include form validation to ensure proper data entry.

News images should be uploaded to a folder like /uploads and their file paths stored in the database.

🖥️ Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript):

Simple, modern, and responsive layout.

Public page (index.php) should:

Display all news posts in cards or list format.

Each card should show image, title, event date, and short description.

Admin dashboard should:

Include buttons for “Add News”, “Manage News”, and “Logout”.

Use a simple HTML form for adding or editing posts.

⚙️ File Structure Example:
college-news/
├── db.php              → Database connection using PDO
├── index.php           → Displays all news posts publicly
├── login.php           → Admin login page
├── logout.php          → Ends session
├── dashboard.php       → Admin dashboard home
├── add_news.php        → Form for adding news
├── edit_news.php       → Form for editing existing news
├── delete_news.php     → Script to delete posts
├── uploads/            → Folder for uploaded images
├── css/
│   └── style.css       → Website styles
└── includes/
    ├── header.php
    ├── footer.php
    └── auth_check.php  → Checks if admin is logged in

🔒 Security Requirements:

Prevent SQL injection by using prepared statements.

Restrict file uploads to image types only.

Limit access to admin pages using session-based authentication.

🧰 Development Environment:

XAMPP (recommended for beginners)

Apache + MySQL + PHP

Project runs at:

http://localhost/college-news/

📘 Learning Goals (for beginners):

Understanding PHP basics: sessions, forms, PDO, and file uploads.

Setting up a MySQL database and connecting it with PHP.

Learning CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Handling authentication (login/logout) securely.

💡 Optional Future Enhancements:

Add pagination for older news posts.

Allow multiple image uploads per post.

Add a “category” column (e.g., Events, Announcements, Sports).

Add search or filter by date/category.

Add notifications or email alerts when new news is posted.

In short:
Build a College News Portal web app in PHP that allows admins (teachers) to log in and post weekly events or updates.
Students and visitors can view the latest news easily from a clean, mobile-friendly homepage.
The system should be fully functional, secure, and easy to extend.
